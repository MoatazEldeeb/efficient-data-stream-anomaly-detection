# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

## Project Description:
Python script capable of detecting anomalies in a continuous data stream. This stream, simulating real-time sequences of floating-point numbers, could represent various metrics such as financial transactions or system metrics. Your focus will be on identifying unusual patterns, such as exceptionally high values or deviations from the norm.

## Dependencies
Some libraries are needed to be installed. To install them easily execute the following code in the root of the project
```ssh
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage

To run data stream simulator run
```ssh
python data_gen.py
```
and then run main.py to begin live plotting and detections run
```ssh
python main.py
```
